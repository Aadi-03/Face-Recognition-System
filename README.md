# Face-Recognition-System

This is a simple project to demonstrate the use of python in Face Recognition using Open CV library.

This proejct uses Haarcascade_frontalface_default XML for recognition of the person in live and Tkinter library for creating GUI

admin_face folder stores the images of the admin face for login purpose. If you are starting the program for the first time, you need to use "hello" (without quotation marks) in the username and password fields.

Now, you can scan your face so that it can be used for login in future. You can also update the admin face and the credentials for login.

user_face folder stores the all images of the users. These are used for recognising the user in the future. However these users cannot login in the system. Only admin can login either with credentials or facial recognition.
